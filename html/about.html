      <h3>About me</h3>

      <p>
        I am a Research Associate at
        <a href="https://www.kcl.ac.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
          >King’s College London</a
        >, having completed my PhD within the
        <a
          href="https://www.kcl.ac.uk/research/hcc"
          target="_blank"
          rel="noopener"
          >Human-Centred Computing Research Group</a
        >
        under the supervision of
        <a href="https://tdjneate.github.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
          >Dr Timothy Neate</a
        >
        and

          augmentative and alternative communication (AAC)
        </a>
        technologies for people with aphasia following stroke. Through
        participatory design across disadvantaged London communities, I explored
        how smartwatches and smartbadges can act as wearable communication
        safety nets during moments of stress and breakdown, while identifying
        limitations of smartglasses arising from cognitive load. I am currently
        open-sourcing this portfolio of wearable AAC tools.

      <p>
        More recently, my work has engaged with the growing role of generative
        AI in accessibility. During an internship with the
        <a

          rel="noopener"
          >Martez Mott</a
        >
        and colleagues, I contributed to the design of remote meeting agents for
        Microsoft Teams to support chronically ill people in maintaining
        employment and social connection. I am now developing
        <a href="https://www.advokit.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
          >Advokit</a
        >, an inclusive GenAI-enhanced toolkit co-designed with people with
        aphasia to support access to public services, including benefit
        navigation, community stories, and language assistance tools.

      <p>
        Outside of my research, I have a wide variety of interests.
        Particularly, I really enjoy sports, reading, travel, film and food.
        Currently, I am a long suffering Manchester United fan and have always
        been an avid golfer. My family has three dogs (pictured elsewhere on
        site) which means plenty of walking. If I am not frantically typing into
        a computer you'll most probably find me enjoying a cup of coffee or a
        good pint of bitter!
